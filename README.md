# telegram-bot-gptassistedproject.01.01
My first ever working code. Was heavily assisted by chat gpt3.5. I learned structure of python. How to work in pycharm(community). How to work and install needed packages. How to work in virtual environment. A vivid understanding of bugfixing and understanding the problems.

Version of python-telegram-bot I worked with: 13.11
Verison of requests: 2.32.3
Python used for project: Python 3.11.9 (tags/v3.11.9:de54cf5, Apr  2 2024, 10:12:12) [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

This is starting point in my journey in programming. I used chatgpt to create whole code for me but I still learned a lot. Since this was my first pet project I had no idea how to work with PyCharm (in this case), 
how to install packages, how to create and activate .venv, but now I have an understanding of what is needed for such a project to work. 

Yes, I still don't have complete understading of syntaxis of python and all that, but I still got a lot from making this bot. In the end I hosted it on free basis at PythonAnywhere.com and it should be still running. 
I found API that I need to implement stuff that I really want in my bot but it is available only in Ruby so my next waypoint is gonna be studying Ruby. 

For now I will keep working with python, its packages, and virtual enviroments in my new favourite IDE PyCharm (Community edition). I will read some books, maybe courses and guides to more deeply understand how
programming works in general and python more specifically for now. 

Also started to figure out how to work with .git! Hello world!
